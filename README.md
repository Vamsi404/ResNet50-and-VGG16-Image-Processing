# ResNet50-and-VGG16-Image-Processing
This repository demonstrates image classification using the ResNet50 model and feature extraction using the VGG16 model, both pre-trained on ImageNet. The code covers loading images, preprocessing, class prediction decoding with ResNet50, and extracting feature representations with VGG16.
